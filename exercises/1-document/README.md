Where to write HTML
-------------------

You've probably come across simple text files, those that have a `.txt` extension.

For such a text file to become an **HTML document** (instead of a text document), you need to use an .html extension.

Tasks
=====

1. Open your text editor, and copy paste the following:

    ```html
    <p>This is my first HTML document!</p>
    ```

2. Save this file as `document.html` and just open it with your browser, and youâ€™ll see:

    ```
    This is my first HTML document!
    ```
